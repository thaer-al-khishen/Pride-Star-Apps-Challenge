# Pride-Star-Apps-Challenge
This is an app gets a list of the top stories by New York Times in a nice design with an option to bookmark an article to save it locally and read it later. The user can also click on any news article from the list to display its detail page, from which, the user can click on a link to navigate to a web page containing more info about this news title.  

I'm using the JSON API at https://developer.nytimes.com/

This app includes:

1- RxJava, a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.

2- MVVM architecture that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface (the view) – be it via a markup language or GUI code – from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model) so that the view is not dependent on any specific model platform. 

3- Dagger Hilt, the latest trend in dependency injection.

4- Databinding with adapters.

5- ROOM database to access the app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.

6- Kotlin Coroutines for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks.
